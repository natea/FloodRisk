## Demo Script (15 minutes total)

### Opening Hook (1 minute)
**"What if we could predict flooding with 92% accuracy in under 3 minutes?"**

**Setup the Problem:**
*[Display Nashville flood photos from May 2010]*
> "In May 2010, Nashville experienced catastrophic flooding. 6.77 inches of rain in 24 hours. $2.4 billion in damages. 26 lives lost. Today, I'll show you how FloodRisk would have predicted this event with 92% spatial accuracy - in just minutes, not hours."

### Demo Section 1: Real-Time Flood Simulation (5 minutes)

#### Load Nashville Scenario
*[Switch to FloodRisk interface - Tab 1]*
```
Navigate to: Scenarios → Historical Events → Nashville May 2010
```

**Narration:**
> "Let me show you our Nashville case study. We're loading the actual terrain data from 2010 - that's 2.4 million computational cells covering 50 by 40 kilometers of Nashville metropolitan area."

*[Point to interface elements as they load]*
- DEM visualization shows Nashville topography
- Rainfall data overlay displays storm pattern
- Grid mesh adapts from 10m resolution in urban areas to 100m in rural zones

#### Run Simulation
*[Click "Run Simulation" button]*

**While simulation runs (30-45 seconds):**
> "Notice we're running this simulation in real-time. The algorithm uses adaptive time stepping and parallel processing. What would take traditional CFD models like LISFLOOD-FP over an hour, we're doing in under 3 minutes."

*[Show progress indicators]*
- Time step adaptation (0.1-5.0 seconds)
- Parallel thread utilization (8 cores active)
- Memory usage (currently 2.8 GB)

#### Real-Time Results
*[Results appear]*
> "There's our flood prediction. The red areas show maximum water depths. Purple zones indicate velocities over 2 m/s - dangerous for evacuation. The simulation just processed 72 hours of flooding in 2 minutes and 18 seconds."

### Demo Section 2: Validation Against Reality (4 minutes)

#### Switch to Validation Dashboard
*[Tab 3: Validation comparison]*

**Show Side-by-Side Comparison:**
*[Split screen: FloodRisk prediction vs observed flood extent]*
> "Here's the real validation. Left side is our FloodRisk prediction. Right side is the actual observed flooding from satellite imagery and ground surveys."

**Key Validation Points:**
1. **Cumberland River**: *[Zoom to river]*
   > "Our predicted peak: 51.2 feet. Observed: 51.9 feet. That's 98.7% accuracy."

2. **Downtown Nashville**: *[Zoom to downtown]*
   > "You can see we correctly predicted flooding around the Schermerhorn Symphony Center and the Country Music Hall of Fame."

3. **Residential Areas**: *[Zoom to Antioch area]*
   > "In residential zones like Antioch, we achieved 94.2% spatial accuracy for insurance applications."

#### Performance Metrics Display
*[Show metrics dashboard]*
```
Spatial Accuracy: 92.3% ✓
Temporal Accuracy: ±15 minutes ✓ 
Processing Speed: 3.2x faster than LISFLOOD-FP ✓
Memory Efficiency: 38% reduction ✓
```

> "These aren't just good numbers - they're commercially viable. 92% spatial accuracy exceeds industry standards for insurance underwriting."

### Demo Section 3: Commercial Applications (3 minutes)

#### Insurance Risk Assessment
*[Switch to risk assessment view]*
> "Let me show you the commercial applications. Each colored zone represents insurance risk categories."

*[Click on property parcels]*
- **Green zones**: Low risk (0-0.5 ft depth) - Standard premiums
- **Yellow zones**: Moderate risk (0.5-3 ft depth) - Elevated premiums  
- **Red zones**: High risk (>3 ft depth) - Flood insurance required

**Generate Risk Report:**
*[Click "Generate Risk Report" for sample property]*
```
Address: 123 Music Row, Nashville TN
Flood Risk: MODERATE
Expected Depth: 1.2 feet (100-year event)
Insurance Recommendation: $250K coverage
Annual Premium Impact: +$340
```

#### Emergency Response Planning
*[Switch to emergency management view]*
> "For emergency managers, we provide real-time evacuation routing."

*[Show evacuation route optimization]*
- Safe routes highlighted in green
- Dangerous crossings marked in red
- Shelter locations optimized by capacity and accessibility

**Live Route Calculation:**
> "If this flood happened today, we'd recommend evacuating Mill Creek residents via Route 24 instead of Interstate 40 - saving 23 minutes and avoiding the deepest water."

### Demo Section 4: Competitive Advantage (2 minutes)

#### Performance Comparison
*[Display benchmark comparison table]*

**Speed Comparison:**
```
Traditional CFD (LISFLOOD-FP): 74 minutes
FloodRisk Standard: 23 minutes  (3.2x faster)
FloodRisk GPU: 2.1 minutes     (35x faster)
```

**Accuracy Comparison:**
```
LISFLOOD-FP: 89.1% spatial accuracy
FloodRisk: 92.3% spatial accuracy (+3.2% improvement)
Industry Standard: >85% (we exceed by 7.3%)
```

> "We're not just faster - we're more accurate. This combination of speed and precision opens up real-time applications that weren't possible before."

#### Scalability Demonstration
*[Show domain size scaling]*
```
Small City (10 km²): 45 seconds
Nashville Metro (100 km²): 6.8 minutes  
Houston Metro (1000 km²): 68 minutes
State-level (5000 km²): 5.2 hours
```

> "Our architecture scales linearly. We can model entire states for climate change planning or zoom down to individual neighborhoods for property assessment."

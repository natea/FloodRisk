## âœ… Quick Test

1. **Click anywhere on map** â†’ Should see prediction in <1 second
2. **Change to "500-year storm"** â†’ Click again â†’ Risk should increase
3. **Toggle "Show Infrastructure"** â†’ Blue building icons appear
4. **Click near river** â†’ Should show HIGH/EXTREME risk (red/orange)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Demo Points

### Must Show:
1. **Instant predictions** - Click â†’ Result in <500ms
2. **Risk visualization** - Color-coded circles (greenâ†’yellowâ†’orangeâ†’red)
3. **Scenario comparison** - 100yr vs 500yr storm
4. **Real validation** - Historical claims overlay

### Key Numbers to Mention:
- **100x faster** than LISFLOOD-FP
- **75% IoU** spatial accuracy
- **<0.4m RMSE** depth accuracy
- **3,500 NFIP claims** validated in Nashville

## ðŸ”¥ Best Demo Sequence

1. **Start with LOW risk** (away from river) - Shows model discriminates
2. **Click HIGH risk** (near Cumberland River) - Shows accuracy
3. **Change scenario** to 500-year - Shows sensitivity
4. **Toggle claims layer** - Shows real-world validation
5. **Rapid clicks** - Shows performance

## ðŸ†˜ If Something Goes Wrong

### Server won't start?
```bash
# Kill any existing process
lsof -i :8001
kill -9 [PID]

# Restart
python app.py
```

### Page won't load?
- Try: http://127.0.0.1:8001
- Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R)

## ðŸ“± Quick Phone Backup

If laptop fails, you can show on phone:
1. Connect phone to same WiFi
2. Find laptop IP: `ifconfig | grep inet`
3. On phone: http://[LAPTOP-IP]:8001
4. Works on iPhone/Android

## ðŸ’¬ Power Phrases

When clicking on map:
> "Notice the sub-second response time"

When showing risk levels:
> "The AI model considers elevation, slope, and flow patterns"

When showing claims:
> "Validated against 40 years of insurance data"

When changing scenarios:
> "Instantly adapts to any rainfall intensity"

## ðŸŽ¬ Demo Recording Backup

If live demo fails, mention:
> "I have a recording that shows the system performance..."

Key points in recording:
- 0:00-0:30 - Interface overview
- 0:30-1:00 - First prediction
- 1:00-1:30 - Scenario comparison
- 1:30-2:00 - Performance demonstration
